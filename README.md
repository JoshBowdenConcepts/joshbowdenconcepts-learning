    <p>As a developer every day is a learning day. My goal with this site is to create a place where I can capture all of my learnings and put them into one place for my own reference later on. I also intend to use this site as practice for web development techniques that I pick up over time. I plan to keep it as accessible as possible, automatically deployed, and structured using modern CSS practices.</p>
